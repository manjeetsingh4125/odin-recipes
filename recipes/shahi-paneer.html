        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Shahi Paneer is deliciously rich and creamy, making it one of the most popular recipes in Mughlai cuisine. 
            Fresh, unmelting cheese is married with a creamy gravy, perfect for serving with naan or roti. “Shahi” means “royalty,” 
            and I can promise this dish is fit for a King! If you are looking for a warming, comforting vegetarian dish to serve for 
            supper, look no further. Shahi Paneer is one of my very favorite dishes and is sure to become one of yours, too.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tablespoons cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
            <li>4 tomatoes, pureed</li>
            <li>1/2 pound paneer, cubed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft 
                and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder over the onion and garlic; 
                continue cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; cook until the excess liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes.
                 Add the paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the mixture; stir gently so the paneer does not break apart. Cook until the 
                 paneer begins to absorb some of the liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir the cream into the mixture and simmer another 
                 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.</li>
        </ol>
