        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Shahi Paneer is deliciously rich and creamy, making it one of the most popular recipes in Mughlai cuisine. 
            Fresh, unmelting cheese is married with a creamy gravy, perfect for serving with naan or roti. “Shahi” means “royalty,” 
            and I can promise this dish is fit for a King! If you are looking for a warming, comforting vegetarian dish to serve for 
            supper, look no further. Shahi Paneer is one of my very favorite dishes and is sure to become one of yours, too.</p>
